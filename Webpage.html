				What is Artificial Intelligence?
			</h2>
			<p class="text">
				Intelligence can be defined as a general mental ability for reasoning, problem-solving, and learning. Because of its general nature, intelligence integrates cognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, or planning. On the basis of this definition, intelligence can be reliably measured by standardized tests with obtained scores predicting several broad social outcomes such as educational achievement, job performance, health, and longevity.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that aims to imbue software with the ability to analyze its environment using either predetermined rules and search algorithms, or pattern recognizing machine learning models, and then make decisions based on those analyses. In this way, AI attempts to mimic biological intelligence to allow the software application or system to act with varying degrees of autonomy, thereby reducing manual human intervention for a wide range of functions.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Spending money on AI projects could ultimately cut down costs on lengthy manual tasks people would have to conduct instead. This isn't just a financial cost, but a time cost, as tasks like data analysis and tracking have been done by human hand in the past.

				Where is AI Being Used?
			</h2>
			<h3 class="text">
				Medicine
			</h3>
			<p class="text">
				In medicine, AI is already more accurate when it comes to designing personalized treatments, or predicting heart attacks. When AI is combined with human diagnosis, the error rate is only 0.5% -compared to 3.5% for human doctors. According to WHO, in the European region, non-communicable diseases cause approximately 89% of premature deaths, thus better diagnostics would contribute to saving millions of lives.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text">
				Farming and Agriculture
			</h3>
			<p class="text">
				Indian farmers are using AI, which takes into consideration data like changing weather patterns, production and sowing area to inform their decisions when to sow. This increased their yield by 30% per hectare, reduced pest-related risks and predicted prices up to three months in advance.

				Limitations of AI
			</h2>
			<p class="text">
				The most pervasive limitation of AI adoption is data. AI needs data to learn to perform its function. In most companies, data is typically siloed and rarely consistently catalogued and governed. Without good, relevant training data, a company will find it quite hard to get started with AI.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Another limitation to AI is that machines often don't know what they don't know. While AI is fantastic for interpreting large volumes of information, there is no guarantee that the technology will understand all the data.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Decisions based on data are not necessarily free of bias. For instance, machines learn very quickly to exhibit some of our worst traits, such as being racist or sexist. ProPublica found that a US court program to assess risks of reoffending was systematically biased against black prisoners — flagging them as almost twice more likely to re-offend than white prisoners.

				AI Vs Humans
			</h2>
			<p class="text">
				The question between artificial intelligence and human intelligence is not a matter of ‘who will win?’ but how are they connected, and how will they co-exist? This emerging technological advancement raises the question: what will be left for humans to do? If robots and machines can do our jobs in the future, the same way we do them or even better, where do humans fit in the equation?
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				The most evident impact of AI is the consequence of the automation of tasks across a broad range of industries, transformed from manual to digital. Tasks or roles that include a degree of repetition or the consumption and interpretation of vast amounts of data are now delivered and processed by a computer, sometimes not needing the intervention of humans.
